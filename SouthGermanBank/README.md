<h1>The South German Bank </h1>

Research oriented solutions which aim to improve not just the product/service but also the operations and
efficiency is what differentiates the outstanding.<br><br>
This is one of my projects in fintech sector. I aim to build a web application that will help a banks internal 
operations to organize and perform better.

1. I have used HTML, CSS for Frontend development. 
2. For Backend development I have used Python. This includes <b>Django </b> and <b> Django Rest Framework</b>.
The data architecture is monolith for the limited scope of the project.


I have also used pandas and scikit-learn library for AI and ML modelling for
<b> Predicting Customer Credit Risk </b>.


<h3>
Customer Application
	</h3> <br>
This application contains data model for customer credit risk parameters, customer personal information.

This application also handles the prediction for a customer's credit risk.
The admin can enter the credit risk parameters and the credit risk of the customer through admin portal. 
This application is designed keeping in mind that there are people coming every day to the bank and 
getting themselves registered for the service and the admin is required to note their information.

<h3>
Visitor Application
	</h3><br>
This application contains data models for containing personal information of visitors who would like 
to enquire about the service (prediction of their credit risk). 
The Visitor can submit his/her request or any query regarding the credit risk. 
The admin will then be able to contact the visitor to get their credit risk evaluated.

<h3>
Data Cleaner Application
    </h3> <br>
This Application engages with bank employees' data engineering teams to organize 
their Data Cleaning repositories and uses their data cleaning  methods based on BANK's Data Cleaning 
Framework.
As the number of solutions grow to significant number, this application can be used directly by
the data cleaning teams to clean the data with a few clicks of buttons. 

<h3>
Data Reader Application
	</h3><br>
This application takes input as either a csv file, or a json file with cleaned data 
(since these are 2 of the most commonly used methods for reading the data and using it for preprocessing.

So, the user is only required to upload a file (csv or json) which will then be
read by the application and the data can be used to predict the credit risk.
